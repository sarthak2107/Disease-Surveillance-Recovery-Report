## Why This Project ❓

In today’s data-driven healthcare environment, **quick and accurate visualization of patient data** is crucial for tracking disease patterns and recovery trends. However, many institutions lack access to complex tools like Power BI or Tableau.

This project was created to demonstrate how **Microsoft Excel**, a widely accessible tool, can be leveraged to build **interactive, insightful dashboards** for real-time analysis.

By using Excel’s advanced features like Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Dynamic Charts, this project:
- Empowers users to analyze health data without needing to code.
- Bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
- Helps healthcare professionals, analysts, and students make informed decisions based on clean, visual data representation.
